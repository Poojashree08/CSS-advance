            <p>
                In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner’s daughter.
            </p>
            <p>He decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman’s daughter.</p>

            <p>Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.</p>
            <p>The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.</p>
            <p class ="story">The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn’t have to marry the loan-shark..</p>
            <p>Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman’s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he’d <span class ="black">picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag.</span></p>
            <p class ="story">He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.</p>
            <p>The daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:

                Refuse to pick a pebble from the bag.
                Take both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.
                Pick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father’s freedom.</p>
            <p>She drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it ‘accidentally’ dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;</p>
            <p class ="story">“Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.”</p>
            <p>The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn’t want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father’s debt.</p>
